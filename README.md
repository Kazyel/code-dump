# Random (kinda shit) Codes

This repo contain random pieces of code of a variety of topics and technologies (mostly JavaScript though).

They were made while I was learning new things, testing scenarios to better understand and get the grasp of concepts/languages, or trying to make myself cool things I saw on the internet.

I like to save them just to keep track of my progress and remember things if I need to. Kinda silly, but yeah.
