# 🧠 Code Dump

> *"An organized chaos of learning, this is my sandbox.  
> Snippets today, skills tomorrow."*

Welcome to **Code Dump** — my personal coding sandbox.  
Here I drop small experiments, quick snippets, tests, and random ideas I use to learn, practice, or just play with code.

## 📂 What you'll find here
- 🔎 Small tests and proof-of-concepts  
- 📚 Snippets from tutorials, docs, and personal experiments  
- 🧩 Random utilities and "just for fun" scripts  
- 🚀 Work-in-progress ideas that might evolve into bigger projects  

## 💡 Purpose
This repository is not meant to be polished or production-ready.  
It’s a **living notebook of code** — a place where I can:
- Practice concepts and algorithms  
- Explore new tools, libraries, and languages  
- Fail fast, learn faster  

## 🛠️ Techs you might see
Depending on what I’m learning, you’ll find bits of:
- JavaScript / TypeScript  
- Go  
- Python  
- Shell scripts  
- …and whatever else I’m curious about  

## ⚡ Usage
Feel free to explore, fork, or grab any snippet you find useful.  
Just keep in mind: things here may be **rough, unoptimized, or incomplete** — because that’s the point.
