Graphs

A graph is a collection of nodes (also called vertices) and edges (also called links) that connect pairs of nodes. Graphs are used to model relationships between objects or entities.

Graphs can be used to represent a wide range of real-world problems, such as social networks, transportation networks, and computer networks.

There are two main types of graphs: directed graphs and undirected graphs. In a directed graph, the edges have a direction, while in an undirected graph, the edges have no direction.

Graphs can be represented using various data structures, such as adjacency matrices, adjacency lists, and adjacency trees. The choice of data structure depends on the specific problem and the operations that need to be performed on the graph.
