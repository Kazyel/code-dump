/**
 *  Selection Sort
 *
 *  Selection sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly finding the minimum element from the
 *  unsorted portion of the array and placing it at the beginning of the sorted portion.
 *
 *  The algorithm divides the array into two parts: a sorted portion (initially empty) and an unsorted portion (initially the entire array).
 *  In each iteration, it finds the smallest element in the unsorted portion and swaps it with the first element of the unsorted portion,
 *  effectively growing the sorted portion by one element.
 *
 *  Time complexity: O(n^2)
 *  Space complexity: O(1)
