/**
 * Closures
 * 
 * A closure is a function that has access to the outer (enclosing) functionâ€™s variables 
 * (usually its free variables), even when that function is executing in a different scope.
 * 
 * In JavaScript, closures are created every time a function is created. 
 * A closure is created when a function is defined, not when it is called.
 * 
 * In JavaScript, a closure has access to its lexical environment, which consists of 
 * all the variables in its scope, whether or not those variables are declared with the 
 * var keyword. A closure can close over variables that are in a higher scope than itself.
 * 
 * In JavaScript, the scope chain is formed by function calls. When a function is called, 
 * a new scope is created. When the called function returns, its scope is destroyed. 
 * The scope chain forms a chain of nested scopes, with the global scope at the top.

/**
 * Memoization
 * 
 * Memoization is a design pattern that caches the results of function calls so that 
 * subsequent calls with the same arguments can be served from the cache, instead of 
 * recomputing the function results.
 * 
 * Closures can be used to implement memoization.
